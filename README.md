# python-modules-explained
An explanation of Python modules for Ada students

Start with `run_app.py` and try to follow the imports and read the explanations for each one. Ping Sara in slack if you have any questions about it and she'll update the repository with more descriptive help to make this more useful for y'all!

While this is a practical example, you should also try to take a look at the official Python documentation about modules, located here: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html>. It's good stuff! If you find yourself asking any questions, open an issue or ping Sara in slack with questions.
